NewAPI perfectly supports the OpenAI Chat Completion and Responses interfaces. Click "OpenAI" to enter the OpenAI provider configuration page.

In the pop-up dialog box, set the API Base URL to NewAPI's interface address. If you have deployed NewAPI locally, fill in the local address, for example `http://localhost:3000/v1`. If you are using a NewAPI service provided by a third-party service provider, fill in the corresponding URL address, for example `https://api.example.com/v1`.

Then, enter the API Key into the "API Key" field and click the "Save" button.
